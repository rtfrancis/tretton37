# tretton37

#### Installation: 

After you've cloned the project, cd into the "tretton37" folder and run `npm install`. After that has finished, run `npm run client-install`. Once those are done, you can start the server and run the app with `npm run prod`.

#### Project:

I've built a page that displays the current colleagues of Tretton37, which gives options to sort and filter through them based on office or name. The data used is retrieved through a scraper and node.js. Because the page is very basic in content, I added some sort of animation to all selectable elements to make it more interesting. 

The code is designed to be reusable, and could still be broken even smaller, interchangeable pieces. This goes for the css modules as well, as placing the selectors into individual modules makes locating and editing much easier.

#### Stories:

<u>Design/accessiblity:</u> 

- <u>Fancy animations (1)</u>: As a frontend developer with no design knowledge, I wanted to catch the eye somehow.
- <u>No UI framework used (1)</u>: I'm familiar with some of these frameworks, but I've always liked the flexibility of styling myself. 

<u>Functionality:</u> 

- <u>Sort by name and office (1)</u>: With so many employees I thought both sort and filter options would be very practical to have. With more time, I would have aimed to make them much more advanced. 
- <u>Filter by name and office (1)</u>: Same as above.
- <u>Node.js server and scraper (4)</u>: I had never built a scraper and I thought this would be a fun exercise. 

<u>Testing/QA:</u>

- <u>Works in Chrome, Firefox, Edge (1)</u>: I thought it was important for the page to work on the most used browsers.
- <u>Unit Testing (2)</u>: Unfortunately tests are still something I haven't written and have wanted to learn. This was a great opportunity to at least attempt some.
